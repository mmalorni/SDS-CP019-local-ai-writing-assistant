# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the Local AI Writing Assistant repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

# Project Overview

The AI Local Writing Assistant is a Generative AI application designed to assist with creative writing tasks such as crafting LinkedIn posts, writing company brochures, and creating short stories. This project will use Ollama to download and run a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) locally. The app will feature a Gradio-based user interface to make it accessible for beginners while allowing advanced users to extend its functionality. The final app will be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Objectives

- **Local Model Setup**: Use Ollama to download and run a lightweight LLM locally, ensuring offline accessibility and cost efficiency.
- **Creative Writing Assistant**: Build functionality for different writing tasks, such as LinkedIn posts, marketing content, and storytelling.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly UI using Gradio for interacting with the LLM.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy the app on Hugging Face Spaces for easy sharing and public access.

## Project Deliverables

- **Local Model Setup**:
  - Install and configure Ollama to download and run a lightweight LLM.
  
- **Backend Logic**:
  - Functions for generating LinkedIn posts, brochures, and short stories.
  - Prompt engineering to guide the model for different writing tasks.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - A Gradio-based user interface with:
    - Dropdowns for writing modes.
    - Text boxes for input prompts and model-generated outputs.
    - Tone and length customizations.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Fully functional Gradio app deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Clear and concise comments and documentation of code on the GitHub repo

## Technical Requirements

- **Model**:
  - Lightweight LLM downloaded and run using Ollama (llama2, Qwen2, mistral).
  
- **Backend**:
  - Python with prompt engineering logic for generating creative content.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - Gradio for the user interface.
  
- **Environment**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Libraries: ollama, gradio, torch, transformers.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Hugging Face Spaces.

## Workflow

### **Phase 1:** Local Model Setup (Ollama)
- Install Ollama and download a lightweight LLM.
- Test basic interactions with the LLM locally.

### **Phase 2:** Backend Development
- Build chat functionality.
- Implement writing assistant functions:
  - Short Story Creator *(Level 1)*.
  - LinkedIn Post Generator *(Level 1)*.
  - Brochure Writer *(Level 2)*.
- Use prompt engineering for flexible outputs based on tone and length.

### **Phase 3:** Frontend Development
- Build an interactive Gradio interface with:
  - Dropdowns for writing modes *(Level 2)*.
  - Text inputs for custom prompts.
  - Outputs displaying the generated content.

### **Phase 4:** Deployment
- Push the Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces for public access.
